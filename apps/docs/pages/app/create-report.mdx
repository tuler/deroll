# createReport

Creates a report output while processing a request.
The difference between a report and a notice is that a report is not provable on the base layer, as it doesn't have a proof.
It's just informational and can be used to log data.

## Usage

The following simple example creates a report output with the payload `"hello"` string.

```ts twoslash
import { createApp } from "@deroll/app";
import { stringToHex } from "viem";

// create application
const app = createApp({ url: "http://127.0.0.1:5004" });

// log incoming advance request
app.addAdvanceHandler(async (data) => {
    const id = await app.createReport({ payload: stringToHex("hello") }); // [!code focus]
    return "accept";
});
```

## Returns

Type: `number`

The id of the report output.

## Parameters

### payload

Type: `Hex`

Binary payload of the report, hex-encoded.
