# Quick Start

## Overview

[Cartesi](https://cartesi.io) is an application-specific rollups technology that allows developers to build powerful decentralized rollups applications using any programming language or library (as long as it compiles to RISC-V).
It does that by running the application inside a powerful virtual machine, the Cartesi VM, that can run an entire Linux OS.

Deroll is a collection of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) libraries that helps developers to build Cartesi applications, by introducing a framework and concepts familiar to TypeScript developers.

## Installation

Before you start building you need to setup the Cartesi development environment:

- Install Docker Desktop on [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/), [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/) or [Windows with WSL2](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/).
- Install the Cartesi CLI

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install -g @cartesi/cli
```

```bash [brew]
brew install cartesi/tap/cartesi
```

:::

If you have any issues, please refer to the [official installation guide](https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/1.5/development/installation/) for more information.

## Create a project

Execute the command below to create a new deroll application. It will guide you through some project options.
:::code-group
```bash [pnpm]
$ pnpm create @deroll/app
```
```bash [npm]
npm init @deroll/app
```
```bash [yarn]
yarn create @deroll/app
```
:::

If you select the default options (no wallet or router library, more on that later), you will get the following `src/index.ts` file.

```ts twoslash [src/index.ts]
/// <reference types="node" />
// ---cut---
import { createApp } from "@deroll/app";

// create application
const app = createApp({ url: "http://localhost:5004" });

// log incoming advance request
app.addAdvanceHandler(async ({ metadata, payload }) => {
    console.log({ metadata, payload });
    return "accept";
});

// log incoming inspect request
app.addInspectHandler(async ({ payload }) => {
    console.log(payload);
});

// start app
app.start().catch((e) => process.exit(1));
```

This application reads inputs (requests) from an HTTP server running at port 5004 inside the Cartesi machine, and only prints those inputs to the `console`.

## Build Cartesi Machine

The next step is to build the application Cartesi Machine, by using the `cartesi build` command.
That will start a build process powered by Docker, and create a Cartesi Machine that is stored in the `.cartesi` directory.
You should see the Cartesi Machine booting and showing the output below:

```bash
$ cartesi build

         .
        / \
      /    \
\---/---\  /----\
 \       X       \
  \----/  \---/---\
       \    / CARTESI
        \ /   MACHINE
         '

Storing machine: please wait
```

## Run Cartesi Node

Now that you built a Cartesi Machine you can run a Cartesi Node with that machine with the `cartesi run` command, which should produce the following output:

```bash
$ cartesi run
prompt-1     | Anvil running at http://localhost:8545
prompt-1     | GraphQL running at http://localhost:8080/graphql
prompt-1     | Inspect running at http://localhost:8080/inspect/
prompt-1     | Explorer running at http://localhost:8080/explorer/
prompt-1     | Bundler running at http://localhost:8080/bundler/rpc
prompt-1     | Paymaster running at http://localhost:8080/paymaster/
prompt-1     | Press Ctrl+C to stop the node
```

This will run a few services on your machine:

1. an [anvil](https://book.getfoundry.sh/anvil/) instance running at http://localhost:8545 which contains all Cartesi infrastructure [smart contracts](https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/1.5/rollups-apis/json-rpc/overview/) deployed to it, and also a few test contracts. You can see the addresses of these contracts by executing the `cartesi address-book` command.

2. a [GraphQL](https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/1.5/rollups-apis/graphql/overview/) server running at http://localhost:8080/graphql which you can use to query outputs produced by your application.
It has a playground UI as well.

3. an inspect server running at http://localhost:8080/inspect/ which you can use to simulate an input, or query read-only computations from your application.

4. an explorer server running at http://localhost:8080/explorer/ which is a Web Application that you can use to view inputs and outputs, and also send inputs to your application.

5. an ERC-4337 bundler server running at http://localhost:8080/bundler/rpc which you can use to implement ERC-4337 support in your application.

6. an ERC-4337 paymaster server running at http://localhost:8080/paymaster/ which you can use to implement ERC-4337 gas sponsorship support in your application.

Some of these services will be used below.

## Send Input

The first step to interact with your application backend is to send an input to it. Tipically inputs will be sent by your application frontend.
For testing you can send inputs directly to the local `anvil` instance using the Cartesi smart contracts, or you can use the `cartesi send` command.

### Send input using `cartesi send`

The `cartesi send` command will guide you through some steps to send different kinds of inputs, like in the example below where we send a string `tuler` as the input to the application.

:::code-group
```bash [command]
cartesi send
? Select send sub-command Send generic input to the application.
? Chain Foundry
? RPC URL http://127.0.0.1:8545
? Wallet Mnemonic
? Mnemonic test test test test test test test test test test test junk
? Account 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266 9999.964983134519619707 ETH
? Application address 0xab7528bb862fb57e8a2bcd567a2e929a0be56a5e
? Input String encoding
? Input (as string) tuler
âœ” Input sent: 0x5f5286566a77de72d5b1c21870a250f15a0d0134c1743624aaa6280a9e5ab8df
```
```bash [log]
validator-1  | [INFO  rollup_http_server::http_service] Received new request of type ADVANCE
validator-1  | [INFO  actix_web::middleware::logger] 127.0.0.1 "POST /finish HTTP/1.1" 200 212 "-" "undici" 0.001408
validator-1  | {
validator-1  |   metadata: {
validator-1  |     msg_sender: '0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266',
validator-1  |     epoch_index: 0,
validator-1  |     input_index: 0,
validator-1  |     block_number: 1487,
validator-1  |     timestamp: 1721999534
validator-1  |   },
validator-1  |   payload: '0x74756c6572'
validator-1  | }
```
```ts [src/index.ts]
// log incoming advance request
app.addAdvanceHandler(async ({ metadata, payload }) => {
    console.log({ metadata, payload }); // [!code focus]
    return "accept";
});
```
:::

If you check in the `cartesi run` log you will see the output above, which is the result of the `console.log(data)` of the application code.
Notice that the `payload` is the hex encoding of the `tuler` string. More on that on the [Data Encoding](/data-encoding) section.

### Send input using `cast`

First you need to [install cast](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation#using-foundryup), a swiss-army knife to play with anvil.

Then you can use the `cast send` command to send inputs to your application through the Cartesi smart contracts.
As an example, to send the `tuler` string as input, you can use the command below:

```bash
cast send \
    --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 \
    0x59b22D57D4f067708AB0c00552767405926dc768 \
    "addInput(address,bytes)" \
    0xab7528bb862fb57e8a2bcd567a2e929a0be56a5e \
    $(cast from-utf8 tuler)
```

where:

- `0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80` is the private key of the first default anvil test account;
- `0x59b22D57D4f067708AB0c00552767405926dc768` is the address of the [InputBox](https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/1.5/rollups-apis/json-rpc/input-box/) contract;
- `addInput(address,bytes)` is the method to send inputs to the application;
- `0xab7528bb862fb57e8a2bcd567a2e929a0be56a5e` is your application smart contract address;
- `$(cast from-utf8 tuler)` is the hex encoding of the `tuler` string.

:::info
The address of the InputBox can also be obtained by executing the command `cartesi address-book --json | jq -r '.InputBox'` and the address of the application with the command `cartesi address-book --json | jq -r '.CartesiDApp'`.
:::

## Querying GraphQL

The inputs received and outputs produced by your application can be queried using a GraphQL API.
Ultimately these GraphQL queries will come from your application front-end, or some intermediate application-specific server.
The local node provides a GraphQL Playground interface running at http://localhost:8080/graphql where you can test your queries.

![GraphQL Playground](/img/graphql-playground.png)

The following example queries the last input received by the application and the first notice of that input.

```graphql
query LatestInput {
    inputs(last: 1) {
        edges {
            node {
                index
                status
                msgSender
                timestamp
                blockNumber
                payload
                notices(first: 1) {
                    edges {
                        node {
                            payload
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

For a comprehensive guide on how to use the Cartesi GraphQL API, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/1.5/rollups-apis/graphql/overview/).

## Inspecting State

Inspect state is useful to execute some kind of application logic that does not change the state of the application.
This can include an input simulation, or a read-only computation to query internal state of the application.

You can make an inspect call using a tool like `curl`, like in the example below.
The path is converted to hex encoding and passed as `payload` to the application.

:::code-group
```bash [command]
$ curl -s http://localhost:8080/inspect/tuler
{"status":"Accepted","exception_payload":null,"reports":[],"processed_input_count":1}
```
```bash [log]
validator-1  | [INFO  rollup_http_server::http_service] Received new request of type INSPECT
validator-1  | [INFO  actix_web::middleware::logger] 127.0.0.1 "POST /finish HTTP/1.1" 200 66 "-" "undici" 0.001024
validator-1  | { payload: '0x74756c6572' }
```
```ts [src/index.ts]
// log incoming inspect request
app.addInspectHandler(async (data) => {
    console.log(data); // [!code focus]
});
```
:::

If you check in the `cartesi run` log you will see the output above, which is the result of the `console.log(data)` of the application code.
Inspected state should be returned as report outputs, in this example no reports were produced.

:::warning
Inspect is a costly operation when compared to querying the GraphQL API.
It actually executes the application code using the Cartesi VM, which is much slower than bare metal execution performance of the GraphQL Server.
So be careful when designing its use in your application.

## Summary

In this section you learned the basics of the development workflow, creating an application, building it, running in a test environment.
In the following sections we will dive deeper into the concepts and features of the deroll framework.
