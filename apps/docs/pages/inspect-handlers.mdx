# Inspect handlers

## Overview

Inspect handlers are async function callbacks that receive the `payload` of an inspect request, and has no return value.
The following example defines an inspect handler that logs the payload, decode it as a string and add a report with the string uppercase value.

```ts twoslash
import { createApp } from "@deroll/app";
import { InspectRequestHandler } from "@deroll/core";
import { stringToHex, hexToString } from "viem";

const handler: InspectRequestHandler = async ({ payload }) => {
    console.log(payload);
    const str = hexToString(payload);
    await app.createReport({ payload: stringToHex(str.toUpperCase()) });
}

// create application
const app = createApp({ url: "http://127.0.0.1:5004" });
app.addInspectHandler(handler);
```

Reports are the only kind of output that inspect handlers should create.
The state of the Cartesi machine as a whole is not modified on an inspect request, so you should only use this kind of request handler to return application state (and not modify the state).

Another useful use case of inspects is to simulate the outcome of an input, like doing some kind of validation logic, and returning the expected result.

Inspect requests are made directly to the Cartesi node through an HTTP GET request to the `/inspect` endpoint.
The following `curl` command creates an inspect request to the local node executed by `cartesi run`, and calls the above handler.

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:8080/inspect/tuler
{"status":"Accepted","exception_payload":null,"reports":[{"payload":"0x54554c4552"}],"processed_input_count":0}
```

Let's use some command line utilities, `jq` and `xxd`, to decode the report payload returned:

```shell
$ curl -slL http://localhost:8080/inspect/tuler | jq -r '.reports[0].payload' | xxd -r -p
TULER
```

We'll leave as an exercise to the reader to use the `fetch` API, and the payload conversion APIs to implement inspect requests using TypeScript.
More details about inspect requests check the [official documentation](https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/1.5/development/send-requests/#advance-and-inspect-requests).
